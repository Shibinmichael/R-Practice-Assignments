We have claims details for the year 2008.
Depending on the cost in 2008, we have divided the group into 5 cost buckets.
Using the data we will now predict  who will fall into each of the cost buckets - using a classification tree. If a person falls under the highest cost bucket, his/her treatment can be monitored/changed to bring the cost down.
