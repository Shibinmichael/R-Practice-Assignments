Using the dataset -Movies, we cluster similar movies so movies from the same group can be recommmended to viewers. The date set consists of the movie details as well as whether the movie is part of one or many genres such as horror, comedy etc.

We perform Hierarchial Clustering and select the cut off at 10. We have ten cluster groups under which the movies can be assigned. The cluster groups are used to provide recommendations.
